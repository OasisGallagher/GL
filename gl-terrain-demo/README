This is a simple OpenGL terrain demo, intended as a programming exercise
and nothing else. The demo showcases water rendering, shadow mapping,
3D model loading and forward rendering Phong-based lighting.

Build requirements
------------------------------------

You need the following dependencies installed on your system:

- Glib
- GLFW3
- SDL Image (1.2)
- glm
- OpenGL

In Ubuntu, these are provided by the following packages:

- Glib:             libglib2.0-dev
- GLFW3:            libglfw3-dev
- SDL Image (1.2):  libsdl-image1.2-dev
- glm:              libglm-dev
- OpenGL:           Mesa or proprietary driver packages

Bulding and excuting the demo
-----------------------------------

$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
$ cd src/
$ ./demo

It is important to execute the last command from inside the src/ directory!

Once the demo is running you can use the keyboard to move and rotate the
camera (up, down, left, right, pageup and pagedown).

Configuration
-----------------------------------

There are many configurable aspects in the demo, most of these are contained
inside the main-constants.h file, feel free to edit this to experiment with
the demo.

You can also tweak the number of objects of each class in main.cpp (look for
the object_count[] array at the beginning of the file).

Objects are randomly positioned on the map. If you want to execute the same
exact scene multiple times you can edit main.cpp and pass a constant argument
to srandom().

Enjoy!
